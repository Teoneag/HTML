(1) The body is the final part of an HTTP request.
(2) Not all HTTP requests have a body.
(3) The length of the body is restricted by the SIZE attribute as stated in the http header.
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
Question 2
Which of the following statements about the Cache-Control header is TRUE?
A. The directive public means that any cache can store the HTTP response.
B. The directive private means that only caches that require authentication can
store the HTTP response.
C. The directive regional means that only caches in the geographic vicinity of the
user who made the HTTP request can store the HTTP response.
D. The directive authenticated means that only caches that require authentication
can store the HTTP response.
Question 3
Which of the following statements about redirections in HTTP is TRUE?
A. Redirection is triggered by a server sending a special redirect response
to a request. Redirect responses have status codes that start with 3,
and a Location header holding the URL to redirect to.
B. Redirection is triggered by the client sending a special redirect request to the
server to access the server holding a copy of the requested resource that is geographically closest to the client. The server responds with a redirect response
which contains a Redirect header holding the web cache IP address that is closest
to the client.
C. Redirection is triggered by the server when encountering a request for a resource
that requires authentication. The WWW-Authenticate header redirects the client
to a URL where the client can authenticate itself to the server.
D. Redirection is triggered by the client after encountering a 404 response from the
server. The client requests an alternative URL for the resource from the server
with the Alt header set to True in the HTTP request.
Question 4

8
9 function ColorMood (n , m) {
10 Color . call ( this , n );
11 this . mood = m;
12 }
13
14 ColorMood . prototype = Object . create ( Color . prototype )
15 ColorMood . prototype . constructor = ColorMood ;
16
17 ColorMood . prototype . getMood = function () {
18 return this . mood ;
19 };
20
21 function ColorMoodUsage (n , m , u) {

A. Object c3 has a direct link to one prototype object.
B. Object c3 tries to access properties (getName, getMood) that the object does not
have. Due to a broken prototype chain, no matching properties are found in the
chain.
C. Property incrUsage was added to the prototype after the creation of object c3
and thus c3 cannot access this property.
D. As the properties name and mood have not been defined on the prototype of c3,
they are not accessible to object c3.

Question 15
Consider the web page defined below. Assume a user opens the web page in a modern
browser. The user presses key 1 three times and then presses key 2 two times. What is
the font size of the two paragraphs after these actions?

1 <! DOCTYPE html >
2 <html >
3 <head >
4 <meta charset ="UTF -8" / >
5 <title > Smaller / bigger </ title >
6 <style >
7 body {
8 font - size : 20 px ;
9 }
10 </ style >
11 </ head >
12 <body >
13 <p>
14 This is the first paragraph .
15 </p>
16
17 <p>
18 This is the second paragraph .
19 </p>
20
21 <script >
22 function getSize ( e ){
23 return parseInt ( window . getComputedStyle (e ). fontSize );
24 }
25
26 document . body . addEventListener (" keydown ", function (e ){
27 if (e. code == 'Digit1 '){ // key "1"
28 document . body . style . fontSize =2 * getSize ( this ) + "px";
29 }
30 })
31
32 document . body . addEventListener (" keydown ", function (e ){
33 if (e. code == 'Digit2 '){ // key "2"
34 document . body . style . fontSize = 0.5 * getSize ( this ) + "px";
35 }
36 })
37 </ script >
38 </ body >
39 </ html >

A. The paragraphs’ font size remains at 20px as event listeners cannot be attached
directly to document.body.
B. The font size of the paragraphs cannot be determined as their font size is never
set in the first place.
C. The font size of the paragraphs is 5px as the second event listener (line 32)
overrides the first one (line 26).
D. The font size of the paragraphs is 40px as both event listeners are valid
and attachable directly to document.body.

Question 16
Consider the source code of Question 15 one more time. In line 28 the keyword this is
used. Which object does this refer to when the user presses keys 1 or 2 ?
A. window
B. document
C. document.body
D. p


Question 17
Consider the web page source code below. Assume a user opens the web page in a modern
browser. The user clicks on the Add Paragraph button once. In which place will <p>New
Paragraph</p> be added?

2 <html >
3 <head >
4 <meta charset ="UTF -8" / >
5 <title > Adding a paragraph </ title >
6 </ head >
7
8 <body >
9 <p> Paragraph 1 </p>
10 <p> Paragraph 2 </p>
11
12 <button class =" button "> Add Paragraph </ button >
13
14 <script >
15 document . getElementsByClassName (" button " )[0]. onclick = addParagraph ;
16
17 function addParagraph () {
18 let p = document . createElement ("p");
19 p. innerHTML = "New Paragraph ";
20 document . body . appendChild (p );
21 }
22 </ script >
23 </ body >
24 </ html >
A. Immediately before <p>Paragraph 1</p>.
B. Immediately after <p>Paragraph 2</p>.
C. Immediately after <button class="button">Add Paragraph</button>.
D. Nowhere. The DOM will not change as the event listener is not actually attached
to the <button> element.

Question 19
Consider a Node.js script that is used to help developers of an e-commerce application to
keep an eye on the number of entries in pricelist.json while they are at home. The file
pricelist.json looks as follows (note that we here show three products with their prices,
but the actual file contains many more):
1 [
2 { " product ": " Astro Bot ", " price ": " 14.15 " },
3 { " product ": " Wimbledon ", " price ": " 29.90 " },
4 { " product ": " Train Simulator ", " price ": " 49.90 " }
5 ]
The Node.js script below is used to keep track of the number of entries in the price list.
It is stored in a file called pricelist-watcher.js and started as follows on the server
(which has IP address 8.8.8.8): node pricelist-watcher.js 4001. The developers in
turn connect to the server via telnet using the following command: telnet 8.8.8.8 4001.
The idea is for them to receive the number of products approximately every five seconds as
a printout on the terminal. What actually happens?
1 const fs = require ("fs");
2 const net = require (" net ");
3
4 const file = " pricelist . json ";
5 const port = process . argv [2];
6
7 const server = net . createServer ( function ( connection ) {
8 setInterval ( function () {
9 fs . readFile ( file , function ( err , data ) {
10 const entries = JSON . parse ( data );
11 connection . write (` Number of products in the system is ${ entries . length }\n `);
12 });
13 }, 5000);
14
15 connection . on (" close ", function () {});
16 });
17
18 server . listen ( port , function () {
19 console . log (" Waiting for clients to connect .");
20 });
Note: assume that the file pricelist.json contains exactly three products.
CSE1500 Resit WEB Exam — Page 10 of 14 07/04/2022

A. Approximately five seconds after connecting, a single message is printed on the terminal Number of products in the system is 3. Afterwards no further messages are printed. This behavior is the same for all clients that connect to the
server via telnet.
B. No message is printed on the terminal. This behavior is the same for all clients
that connect to the server via telnet.
C. Approximately every five seconds, the message Number of products in
the system is 3 is printed on the terminal. This behavior is the same
for all clients that connect to the server via telnet.
D. The behavior differs depending on when a client connects to the server. The first
client that connects receives the message Number of products in the system
is 0 approximately every five seconds. Clients that connect later receive no
message.

Question 20
Consider the following four statements about Ajax:
(1) Ajax is a Node.js mechanism that enables the dynamic loading of content without

(2) Ajax revolves around the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate between
client and servers.
(3) Using Ajax, servers can send several HTTP responses in reply to a single HTTP
request.
(4) Ajax reduces the HTTP request/response cycle overhead as a complete HTTP message
is no longer required for the communication between client and server.
Which of these statements are TRUE?
A. Only 2)
B. Only 3) and 4)
C. All four statements are true.
D. None. All four statements are false.

Question 27
Consider the following Node.js script:
1 const express = require (" express ");
2
3 function logger ( request , response , next ) {
4 console . log (`${ new Date ()} , ${ request . method }, ${ request . url } `);
5 next ();
6 }
7
8 function changeRequest ( request , response , next ){

22 app . get ("*", function ( req , res ){
23 console . log ( req . query )
24 res . end (" Request received . Logging status : "+ req . query . logged )
25 })
26 app . listen (3001);
Assume the script was started on localhost. Entering the URL http://localhost:3001/hello
into the browser’s address bar and pressing Enter has which effect?
A. The browser displays Request received. Logging status: true.
B. The browser displays Request received. Logging status: undefined as it is not
possible to change a request object as done here in line 9.
C. The browser displays nothing. The request is sent to the server but the server
never sends a response due to the incorrect use of the next() function.
D. The browser displays nothing. The request is sent to the server but there is no
route defined for path /hello.
Question 28
Assume that a server sent a number of cookies to a client in response to the client’s HTTP
request. Now another HTTP request by the same client is received and the server wants to
clear all cookies from the client. How can this be achieved?
A. The server includes the header Set-Cookie: clear in the HTTP response. This
informs the browser that all cookies previously sent by the server are invalid and
need to be removed from its cookie storage.
B. The server includes the header Clear-Cookies: true in the HTTP response.
This informs the browser that all cookies previously sent by the server are invalid
and need to be removed from its cookie storage.
C. For each cookie the server wants to clear from the client, the server
sends the cookie to the client with an expiration date in the past.
This informs the browser that this cookie has become invalid and the
browser deletes the cookie from its cookie storage.
D. The server has no possibility to clear any of the cookies it sent to the client. The
client always respects the original expiration date (as set by the server when the
cookie was first sent to the client) of each cookie.
